# ENGEP examples: Repository for examples about how to use ENGEP

## Introduction

This repository contains examples on the usage of [ENGEP](https://github.com/Zhangxf-ccnu/ENGEP) 

## Contents

### Prediction gene expression of unmeasured genes and identification of novel spatial archetypes in osmFISH

This [example](https://github.com/Zhangxf-ccnu/ENGEP-examples/blob/master/Example%20of%20identification%20of%20novel%20spatial%20archetypes%20in%20osmFISH.md)  is a detailed guide on how to work with ENGEP in osmFISH.

### Prediction gene expression of unmeasured genes and identification of novel spatial archetypes in MERFISH

This [example](https://github.com/Zhangxf-ccnu/ENGEP-examples/blob/master/Example%20of%20identification%20of%20novel%20spatial%20archetypes%20in%20MERFISH.md) is a detailed guide on how to work with ENGEP in MERFISH.


## Datasets

All datasets used are publicly available data, for convenience datasets can be downloaded from Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7825993)

For the references of MERFISH are very large, they can be download by using [BDBag](https://github.com/nemoarchive/host-data-on-nemo/wiki/Download-data-using-a-BDBag)
